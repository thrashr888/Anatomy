# Getting Started with a new website

One way to use the Anatomy template is to simply use a copy as the basis of a new project. It's easy. Just clone the git repo, remove the git folder, and start a new one. This is the basic idea of Anatomy. Just grab a copy and get going!

    git clone git://github.com/thrashr888/Anatomy.git

    git submodule init

    git submodule pull

    rm -rf .git

    rm .gitmodules

    git init

    git add *

    git commit -m "initial checkin"


# Included CSS and JS libraries

The most popular open source CSS and JS libraries are provided for you. jQuery and 960 are setup by default but they're easy to swich by simply un-commenting the provided code and removing what's unneeded.

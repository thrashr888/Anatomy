# Anatomy - An HTML Framework

Anatomy includes the basics of a modern HTML template so you don't have to start your HTML from scratch.

  - XHTML 1.0 Transitional
  - Smart defaults including jQuery, 960 and Google Ajax API
  - Layout basics: header, content and footer DIVs
  - CSS Frameworks (960, Blueprint, YUI, Dropdown Menu)
  - JS Frameworks (jQuery, Prototype + Scriptaculous, MooTools, Dojo, YUI, Ext)
  - Google Analytics Tag
  - Text to be replaced is marked by "REPLACE"
  - Hosted at GitHub

## Getting Started

One way to use the Anatomy template is to simply use a copy as the basis of a new project. It's easy. Just clone the git repo, remove the git folder, and start your project. This is the basic idea of Anatomy. Just grab a copy and get going!

Here's how to use Anatomy to start a new project:

    # git clone git://github.com/thrashr888/Anatomy.git
    # rm -rf .git

Or, if you donâ€™t have git, you can just download the latest source as a tarball:

    # curl -L http://github.com/thrashr888/Anatomy/tarball/master -o Anatomy.tar.gz
    # tar xzvf Anatomy.tar.gz

## CSS and JavaScript Frameworks Included

The most popular open source CSS and JS frameworks are provided for you. jQuery and 960 are setup by default but they're easy to swich by simply un-commenting the provided code and removing what's unneeded. The idea of this HTML framework is that the basics are taken care of so you don't have to start from scratch for every new web project.

### CSS Frameworks

At first I linked 960 and Blueprint to their respective repos on GitHub as submodules. I've decided against this to cut down on having too many unneeded files in the folder structure. I also combined 960's files to cut down on HTTP requests.
